\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] Why did you buy a new phone? Don't you have one already?

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] I \textbf{saw} you yesterday and I waved my hand, but you didn't say hi. Why did you ignore me?
  \item[B] Oh I \textbf{thought} you were someone else. Sorry, but didn't have my glasses, so I didn't recognize you. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] I'm sorry for forgetting your birthday last month, but I \textbf{brought} you some pizza!

\end{itemize}

  \item[A] So George, who's your favorite \textbf{author}?

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] George \textbf{caught} me sleeping in class, and I couldn't come up with an excuse.
  \item[B] I \textbf{thought} you were going to start going to bed earlier in order to have more energy for the class. What happened? 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] Did you really play videogames until \textbf{dawn}? How are you going to be awake for the class ?

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] I paid \$1,000.00 for the Iphone 16 on Facebook Marketplace, but now the vendor isn't answering my messages.
  \item[B] How could you \textbf{fall} for that? It was clearly a scam. Sorry, but that money is now gone. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] Did you hear about John? He got \textbf{caught} red-handed stealing money from customers.
  \item[B] Really? I never \textbf{thought} he would break the \textbf{law}. What's going to happen to him now ?  
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] So, how did the date go?
  \item[B] Oh it was \textbf{awful}! I was stood up, so I didn't even meet the person.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] Well, I \text{thought} the movie was going to be \textbf{awesome}, but it was disappointing.
  \item[B] I \textbf{saw} it last week and I \textbf{thought} it was just OK. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[A] Why are you mad at me? It wasn't my \textbf{fault} that you got an F on your test.
  \item[B] Of \textbf{course} it was your \textbf{fault}! You knew we would have a surprise test and you didn't tell me. 
\end{itemize}
